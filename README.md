#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the systematic application of engineering pronciples, methods, and tools to develop amd maintain high-quality software systems.


The importance of softeare engineering cannot be over emphasized in the sense that it helps in making lots of human activities easy.
The apolication of software engineering enables the creation of software applications that cut across different aspects of human endeavours such as communication, commerce, entertainment, healthcare, real estate etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages via the use of Fortran, C, Pascal etc.

The establishment of software engineering systems as a discipline in the 1960s. This gave room to anyone who want to study programming and software engineering to take it as specialised profession.

The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. The agile methodology brought with it flexibility and collaboration which makes it easy for users and developers to engage effectively.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: this phase has to do with gathering of necessary information required for the development of the software from stakeholders.

Design: this phase has to do with the road map on how to go about the product development with specifications and objectives.

Implementation: this is the phase when the engineering team commence the process of coding the product, following the road map in the design phase.

Testing: this phase is for tesing of the program by quality assurance team in order to look for any flaws, bugs or other issues and rectify where necessary.

Deployment: at this stage, the product is ready for production environment. At this stage, buyers will be able to utilise and purchase the product on wide range basis.

Maintenance: this phase is basically for maintenance of the product, now that otys being used by wider range of customers.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is focused more on flexibiloty, collaboration and respond to change when such need arises.

While waterfall is rigid. It requires teams to stick to the requirements and scope of the work set out at the beginning of the project and not make any changes.

comparisons: they both have same procedure such as, requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintenance.
Therefore, they both aimed at achieving the same goals, just that while waterfall sticks strictly to the design and road map, while agile is flexible enough to make changes where needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer is responsible for coding of the product.

Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing of the product in order to ensure that it is bug free.

project manager is responsible for coordinaion of all departments or teams in order to ensure that the design or the road map is strictly followed.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

These are tools used by software engineers to streamline development process.
examples of IDEs include, Visual studio, Eclipse, Intellij Idea.

examples of VCS include, git, subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


the challenges include changing requirements. this is when requirements change during developement cycle which mostly delay the project.

tight deadline is another challenge. software developers are often pressured to deliver software products on agreed date which sometimes leads to compromise of quality.

technical debt is also a challenge. where there's shortfall of technical knowhow on some products, it may be difficult for software developer to maintain such product in future.

how to handle the challenges
The strategies that can be applied in irddr to over come these chalenges include effective communication, agil methodologies, prioritisation of tasks and regular reassessment of project goal and timeline.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing is testing the individual components or module of the software.

integration testing is interractions between different components or subsystems.

acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

they are important because they help in identifying and fixing of defects or bugs early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is process of crafting a question in a way that will bring about best response from the robot or AI assistance. for example, "give me a step by step ways on how to make burger"


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

example of a vague prompt is when you ask the AI "tell me a story on independence" you may end up getting stories that are completely irrelevant.

But if you ask the AI, "tell me story about Nigeria's independence"
you will get relevant information.
